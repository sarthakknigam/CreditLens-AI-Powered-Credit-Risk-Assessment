#  CreditLens — AI-Powered Credit Risk Assessment

An end-to-end **Machine Learning Credit Risk Prediction System** that estimates the probability of loan default using applicant financial, loan, and credit-history information.

The project combines a **calibrated XGBoost model**, optimized decision threshold, **SHAP-based model explainability**, a **FastAPI backend**, and a responsive fintech-style web interface for real-time risk assessment.

---

##  Project Overview

Credit risk assessment is an important problem in financial lending. The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on historical applicant and loan information.

The complete workflow includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Feature transformation
- Logistic Regression baseline
- XGBoost classification
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Probability calibration
- Decision-threshold optimization
- Model evaluation
- SHAP explainability
- Model serialization
- FastAPI integration
- Interactive frontend

The final application returns both a **default probability** and a **Low Risk / High Risk** classification.

##  Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation

The dataset is cleaned and prepared before model training.

The preprocessing workflow handles:

- Numerical features
- Categorical features
- Missing values
- Feature transformations
- Train/test splitting

The preprocessing steps are integrated with the model using a Scikit-learn pipeline.

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is performed to understand:

- Applicant income distribution
- Loan amount distribution
- Loan purpose
- Loan grades
- Home ownership
- Interest rates
- Previous defaults
- Credit history
- Loan default distribution
- Relationships between features and loan default

---

### 3. Baseline Model

A **Logistic Regression** classifier is used as the baseline model.

This provides a reference point for evaluating the performance of more powerful models.

---

### 4. XGBoost Model

The main predictive model is built using **XGBoost**, a gradient-boosting algorithm effective for structured/tabular datasets.

The model learns relationships between applicant characteristics and loan-default outcomes.

---

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve the XGBoost model.

The tuned model is then selected for the final prediction pipeline.

---

### 6. Probability Calibration

Since the application displays the **probability of default**, probability calibration is applied to improve the reliability of the predicted probabilities.

The final classifier uses:

```text

        ↓

```

---

### 7. Decision Threshold Optimization

Instead of relying only on the default classification threshold of `0.50`, the project evaluates precision and recall across different thresholds.

The F1-score is calculated using:

```text
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

The optimized threshold used by the saved model is approximately:

```text
0.6598
```

The application classifies applicants using:

```text
Probability >= Threshold
        ↓
     High Risk

Probability < Threshold
        ↓
      Low Risk
```

---

##  Explainable AI with SHAP

The project uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to improve model interpretability.

Machine-learning models such as XGBoost can be difficult to interpret directly. SHAP helps explain how individual features influence model predictions.

SHAP analysis can be used to understand:

- Global feature importance
- Features contributing to higher predicted default risk
- Features contributing to lower predicted default risk
- Individual feature contributions
- Relationships between features and model predictions

This adds an explainability layer to the credit-risk model instead of treating it purely as a black-box classifier.

---

##  Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using multiple classification metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision-Recall analysis

These metrics provide a more complete evaluation than accuracy alone, particularly for credit-risk classification where the classes may not be evenly distributed.

---

| Feature | Description |

##  Disclaimer

This project is developed for **educational and portfolio purposes**.
